### Styhead Release

| Patch | Description | Affected Layer/Recipe |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| `0001-Add-alsa-tools-to-dependencies-to-fix-build.patch` | Adds alsa-tools to mx93 build dependencies in gstreamer plugin | meta-imx-bsp/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer |

**Purpose**: Resolves missing dependency issues during audio stack builds for i.MX93.

### Walnascar Release

The Walnascar release contains the most patches due to active development and support for newer hardware platforms.

| Patch | Description | Affected Layer/Recipe |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| `0001-meta-imx-folder-name-walnascar.patch` | Fixes folder path from `sources/` to `layers/` for meta-virtualization | meta-imx-sdk/dynamic-layers/virtualization-layer |
| `0002-Add-alsa-tools-to-dependencies-to-fix-build.patch` | Adds alsa-tools to mx93/mx943 build dependencies in gstreamer plugin | meta-imx-bsp/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer |
| `0003-Add-dependencies-for-imx95.patch` | Adds alsa-tools dependency for i.MX95 platform support | meta-imx-bsp/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer |
| `0004-Add-build-fix-for-mpv-package.patch` | Adds upstream status header to mplayer build fix patch | meta-oe/recipes-multimedia/mplayer |

| `0008-AOM5521-Backport-OEI-patches-from-scarthgap-for-A1.patch` | Backports OEI (OpenEmbedded Industrial) patches for AOM-5521 A1 board | meta-fsl-imx/recipes-bsp/imx-oei |
| `0009-Use-lf-6.12.34_2.1.0-branch.patch` | Updates onnxruntime recipe to use lf-6.12.34_2.1.0 branch | meta-imx-ml/recipes-libraries/onnxruntime |

**Purpose**: Supports i.MX95 hardware platforms, particularly the Advantech AOM-5521 boards, and ensures compatibility with the Walnascar Yocto release.

## Feature Patches

### OTA (Over-The-Air Updates)

Patches in the `features/ota/` directory enable and fix OTA update functionality using OSTree technology.

#### OSTree Patches

| Patch | Description | Yocto Release |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `0001-Make-layer-compatible-with-yocto-styhead-release.patch` | Updates meta-updater layer for Styhead compatibility | Styhead |
| `0001-Make-layer-compatible-with-yocto-walnascar-release.patch` | Updates meta-updater layer for Walnascar compatibility | Walnascar |

**Key Changes**:
- Updates `WORKDIR` references to `UNPACKDIR` (new Yocto variable naming convention)
- Updates `LAYERSERIES_COMPAT` to match release codenames
- Fixes path references in image build classes and test cases
- Ensures proper OSTree repository and commit handling

**Affected Components**:
- `classes/image_types_ostree.bbclass` - OSTree image generation
- `classes/image_types_ota.bbclass` - OTA image packaging
- `conf/layer.conf` - Layer compatibility settings
- `lib/oeqa/selftest/cases/updater_qemux86_64.py` - OTA test cases
- `recipes-sota/aktualizr/aktualizr_git.bb` - Aktualizr OTA client recipe

## How Patches Are Applied

Patches are automatically applied during the BSP build process based on:
1. **Vendor selection** - Determines which vendor subdirectory to use
2. **Yocto release** - Selects patches matching the target release version
3. **Features enabled** - Applies feature-specific patches when features are activated

The build system applies patches in numerical order (e.g., `0001-`, `0002-`, etc.) to ensure proper dependency resolution.

## Contributing Patches

When adding new patches:

1. **Use descriptive names**: Follow the pattern `NNNN-Brief-description.patch`
2. **Include patch metadata**: Ensure Subject, From, and Date fields are present
3. **Organize by version**: Place patches in the appropriate Yocto release directory
4. **Document changes**: Update this README with patch description and purpose
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify patches apply cleanly and don't break existing builds

## Maintenance Notes

- Patches are maintained per Yocto release to ensure stability
- When upgrading to a new Yocto release, review and update patches as needed
- Some patches may become obsolete when issues are fixed upstream
- Regular review of patches is recommended to keep the patch set minimal
